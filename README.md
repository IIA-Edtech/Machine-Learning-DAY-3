# Machine Learning Jupyter Notebook files 

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook templates for data science that has content on Regression Models. 
These python files are designed to help you run and understand simple codes on machine learning  modls such as Naive Bayes Classification Model and K-means.

## Notebook Files
This repository contains the following Jupyter Notebook files:

- **Naive Bayes Classification Model:** This file provides a starting point for the construction of a Naive Bayes model in Python. The template includes code for loading relevant packages, importing data, doing EDA, constructing the model and evaluating the results.

- **K-means File:** This file provides a starting point for the construction of a k-mean partitioning model in Python. The notebook includes code for importing libraries, importing data, doing exploratory data analysis, constructing the k-means model and evaluating the model performance.
